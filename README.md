# slsa-provenance-test

This is only used for testing [slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator) and [slsa-verifier](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier).

The latest version of slsa-github-generator (`v1.5.0`) does not fully support private Sigstore tools (Rekor, Fulcio) 
and this repo's software supply chain metadata is exposed to the public Rekor instance as transparency logs.
